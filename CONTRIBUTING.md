## Introduction

Resources is an open-source project accessible to everyone to view and contribute.

A comprehensive hub for Python development, the Resources repository houses crucial documentation, best practices and curated learning materials. Ensuring both beginners and seasoned developers have a one-stop solution for their Python-related endeavors.

It mainly consist of 

- Documentation on [Python Development Setup](docs)
- My Wiki on [Development Best Practices](https://gitlab.com/engineered-in/resources/-/wikis/home)


## Communication Philosophy

### Asynchronous Communication

As with any Open Source Project, the preferred mode of Communication is **ASYNCHRONOUS** (through GitLab Issues, Merge Requests, Comments, etc.).  The main reasons behind the preference are

- Transparency and Record of communication is ensured by GitLab
- Better Focus by enabling flexible Time Management

Asynchronous Communication can be easily achieved by

- [Watching a Project in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/engineered-in/resources/-/wikis/home/Watching-a-Project-in-GitLab)
- [Watching a Person in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/engineered-in/resources/-/wikis/home/Watching-a-Person-in-GitLab)
- [Subscribing to your Issues Feed](https://gitlab.com/engineered-in/resources/-/wikis/home/Subscribing-to-your-Issues-Feed)
- [Subscribing to your Issues Calendar](https://gitlab.com/engineered-in/resources/-/wikis/home/Subscribing-to-your-Issues-Calendar)

We strongly recommend you to read

- the article on "**[How to get started with async](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/)**" by GitLab
- the handbook on "**[GitLab Communication](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/)**"

## Fork the Repository

You need to fork only if you do not have Developer / Maintainer / Owner access to the repository

1. Visit the Fork Project page by visiting [this link](https://gitlab.com/engineered-in/resources/-/forks/new) in a new tab.
2. Review and Update (if required) the Project's
    - Name
    - URL
    - Slug
    - Description (optional)
    - Visibility level

and click the Fork project (blue) button to complete the Fork.


## Finding Issues to Work On

Check our [GitLab issues board](https://gitlab.com/engineered-in/resources/-/boards/).

If you're unsure where to start, look for tags like:

- "good first issue"
- "help wanted"

## Submitting Changes

1. Push your changes to your fork (using GitLab IDE)
2. Create a merge request (MR) on GitLab.
